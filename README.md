# TSUSMP
Welcome to the main client for TSUSMP...

I really got nothing to say, but hope everything works for you all and
thank you for joining

Modpack is actually in a modular state so you have to set your own controls this time but you can add in any mods you see fit!

The server does have some mods that can work with the client as well!

The list of compatible mods:


- JourneyMap - 5.9.15
- Xaero's Minimap (23.8.3) & World Map (1.35.0)
